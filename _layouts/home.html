  Hello and welcome to my site!
  A bit about me:

      <!-- <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/aqibisbiqa/psyduck">PSyDUCK</a>,  -->
      <a href="/projects/1_psyduck/">PSyDUCK</a>, 
      a project that aims to hide covert messages (steganography) within samples generated by diffusion models. 
      This is associated with my Master's dissertation.</li>
    <!-- <li>Currently I'm wrapping up my final dissertation, which explores how to hide covert messages (steganography) within the output of generative diffusion models.</li> -->

      Some of my other research interests include graph neural networks and quantum computing. 
      Take a look at some <a href="/projects/">projects</a> I've completed throughout my career.</li>

<div>
  Aside from tech and academia, I'm passionate about...
  <ul>
    <li>
      ...Cooking! 
      Fast food was practically taboo during my childhood -- naturally I then gravitated towards the kitchen.
      Feast your eyes on my <a href="/recipes-archive/">cooking portfolio</a> for a fun, delicious, practical, and, importantly, <em>ad-free</em> experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      ...Music! 
      In particular, curating thematic playlists and mixing various genres. 
      Check out some of my favorite works <a href="music-archive">here</a>.
      I'm also actively learning to use a keyboard for more than programming :)
    </li>
    <!-- <li>...Basketball! </li> -->
  </ul>
