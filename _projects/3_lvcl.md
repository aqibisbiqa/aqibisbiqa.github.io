# title: "Variational Continual Learning with Laplacian Variational Approximation"
title: "Laplacian VCL"
excerpt: "To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem in complex continual learning problems, the variational continual learning (VCL) framework was developed to ample success. For simplicity, the original model restricts all variational distributions to Gaussians. However, this is often a suboptimal assumption for several use cases of VCL, such as classification of speech, images or videos. To remedy this, we explore alternative, tractable approximations that better represent the statistics of the data. In particular we focus on the Laplacian distribution, which we find to provide substantial performance improvement in the image domain."
