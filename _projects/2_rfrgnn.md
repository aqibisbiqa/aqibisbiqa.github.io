# title: "Readout Optimization for Multigraph Neural Network Classifiers"
title: "R-FR-GNNs"
excerpt: "Learning logical classifiers on multigraphs was relatively unexplored territory at the time of this project's inception. The most performative model was R^2-GNN, which implemented costly readout operations in each model layer to ensure expressivity over the important FOC_2 class. However, we show that the number of costly readouts can be dramatically reduced and still maintain the same performance/expressivity guarantees with a fraction of the resources."
