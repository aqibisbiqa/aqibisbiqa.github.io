title: "PSyDUCK: Perfectly-secure Steganography via Diffusion Using Construction Keys"
excerpt: "This project explores novel techniques in leveraging the added noise during the diffusion process and the improved performance of modern VQ-VAEs to enable a high-throughput steganographic channel with mathematical security guarantees."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposed steganographic scheme with *any* security guarantees on latent diffusion models (image or video), let alone perfect security.
This project is also associated with my final Master's dissertation (WIP).
One can test the code over at <a href = "https://github.com/aqibisbiqa/psyduck">our repo on Github</a>.
