title: "Accelerating Classicial Simulation of Quantum Circuits with the ZX-Calculus and Cat_10 States"
excerpt: "Stabilizer decomposition has proven effective for classically simulating quantum circuits. In conjunction with libraries such as QuiAX, users have the capabilities to simulate their own circuits on consumer hardware. We extend these capabilities with the addition of cat_10 states."
